  description: In this short period of time, I was tasked to make the hydrological model for Mrica-Garung Watershed and Padaherang Watershed in order to make 
               the flood hydrograph with different return period. A new Mrica-Garung Watershed flood hydrograph was needed at that time for comparing 
               the hydrologic analysis of the previous studies. The result from the analysis becomes important in this project for the hydroelectric power plant 
               operation of Great General Soedirman DAM which is located downstream the watershed. Meanwhile, Padaherang hydrograph was used to find such a solution
               to huge crop failure that occurred there due to the flooding. In this place I also enhance my knowledge about the manufacture of raw water 
               for drinking water by making summaries. The purpose of this summaries is for a framework of thinking to make a national regulation standard 
               about the manufacture of raw water.
