# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a hydrologist specializing in early warning systems, currently bringing my expertise to Deltares. With a wealth of experience, I've been instrumental in developing early warning systems both at home and abroad. Some standout projects I've contributed to include the Jakarta Flood Early Warning System (J-FEWS), Indonesia's Water Center of Excellence (Pusat Studi Hidroinformatik), the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), the National Water Resources Information System Cambodia (NWRIS Cambodia) and the Multi-Hazard Platform in Iskandar Malaysia (MHP-IM). My deep understanding of early warning systems in Indonesia comes from engaging interviews with EWS developers across the country as part of the Baseline Study for an End to End Multi-Hazard Early Warning System platform project.
